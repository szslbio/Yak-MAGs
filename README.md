## Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of yak fecal microbiota

Utilizing the fecal samples collected from the domestic yak and shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we have performed assembly and binning to reconstruct 68 metagenome-assembled bacterial and archaeal genomes with completeness greater than 80%. 

## Note

This repository contains Fasta files of the metagenome-assembled genomes for the submitted manuscript "Metagenomic insights into the diversity of carbohydrate-degrading enzymes in the yak fecal microbial community".
